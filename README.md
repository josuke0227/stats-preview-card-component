## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) - For styling
- [react-countup](https://github.com/glennreyes/react-countup) - For styling

### What I learned

It was the first implement using only material-ui.

I've learned to set the CSS property "display: block" when I try to put it in a div element.
Other wise, the div gets a little bit larger than image, it freaked me out when I tried to
implement mask for hero image.
